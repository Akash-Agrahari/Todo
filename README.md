# Todo Application

This is a **Todo Application** built using **React**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **Vite**. The application allows users to manage their tasks effectively by providing features such as adding, editing, deleting, toggling task completion, sorting tasks, and alerting users for tasks due within 1 hour.

---

## Features

### 1. Add Tasks
- Users can create new tasks by providing a task name and a deadline.
- The deadline is selected using a `datetime-local` input, ensuring both date and time are captured.
- The deadline is stored in the format: `YYYY-MM-DD | HH:mm`.

### 2. Edit Tasks
- Users can edit existing tasks, including updating the task name and deadline.
- The deadline is displayed in the `datetime-local` format for easy editing.

### 3. Delete Tasks
- Users can delete tasks they no longer need.

### 4. Toggle Task Completion
- Users can mark tasks as completed or incomplete by toggling a checkbox.
- Completed tasks are visually distinguished with a green background and a strikethrough on the task name.

### 5. Sort Tasks
- Tasks can be sorted by:
  - **Deadline**: Sorts tasks in ascending order of their deadlines.
  - **Name**: Sorts tasks alphabetically by their names.
  - **Completed**: Groups completed tasks at the bottom.

### 6. Alert for Tasks Due Within 1 Hour
- The application checks for tasks due within 1 hour and alerts the user.
- Alerts are triggered only once per task to avoid repeated notifications.
